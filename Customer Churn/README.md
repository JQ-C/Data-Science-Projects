# Customer Churn with bank data
This group project uses a combination of machine learning and deep learning to find out what is the best model to use for customer churn prediction <br>
The list of machine learning used are
- ANN
- Naive Bayes
- Logistics Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine 
<br>
All the models have been implemented with ScikitLearn Library and gridsearch is used to parameter tune the models. <br>
The conclusion is that ANN the proposed model performed the best out of all the model and will only get better as more data is introduced to the model in the future
