# Stroke Prediction with Stoke Data
This group project uses a variety of machine learning model to predict stroke. <br>
All the models are implemented with SciKitLearn library <br>
The list of machine learning models used are
- Decision Tree
- Logistics Regression
- KNN
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
<br>
The conclusion of this project is Logistics Regression is the best model out of all the model implemented.
